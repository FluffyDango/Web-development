        <h2>CS:GO Settings</h2>
        <p>Settings are unique to everyone that's why take these tips with a grain of salt. You don't have to follow what we recommend but hear us out.</p>
        <h2>Recommended setting configuration</h2>
        <ol class="tips">
            <li>Turn off auto pickup</li>
            <p>This is one of the worst settings created. It's called "Switch weapon on pickup" and it is in Game -> item settings. You should never use it, it's just terrible. You are shooting an enemy and you accidently pick up a gun. Then you have to wait while you load or even reload the gun. During that time you are probably already dead.</p>
            <li>Create a custom crosshair</li>
            <p>The default crosshair is playable but not really good. Changing your crosshair may improve your aim.</p>
            <li>16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratio</li>
            <p>This one is very arguable - some people say you can see the player models better on 4:3, but on 16:9 you can see more of the screen. Try out both and see which one is better for you.</p>
            <li>10 second warning music</li>
            <p>10 second warning music is one of the most important settings to use. The music starts when you have 10 seconds left to diffuse the bomb so you either run or try to end it fast. It has saved us a lot of times.</p>
            <li>Max acceptable matchmaking ping</li>
            <p>If you don't want to be stuck with teamates from the other continent you should probably change your Max acceptable matchmaking ping. Because CS:GO doesn't care what ping you get unless you specify it.</p>
            <li>Zoom sensitivity</li>
            <p>Zoom sensitivity has a universal number which makes your scoped gun move the same as unscoped (0.818933). You can experiment with different sensitivity but most people use this.</p>
            <li>Utility keys</li>
            <p>Changing the keybindings for nades is useful but not necessary. We normally use the extra keys on the mouse to change between nades because it's faster and more comfortable.</p>
        </ol>
        <h2>Settings for MAX FPS</h2>
        <ul class="maxFPS">
            <li><span>Global Shadow Quality:</span> Very Low</li>
            <li><span>Model / Texture Detail:</span> Low</li>
            <li><span>Effect Detail:</span> Low</li>
            <li><span>Shader Detail:</span> Low</li>
            <li><span>Boost player contrast:</span> Disabled</li>
            <p>Improves the sight of players in low contrast situations.</p>
            <li><span>Multicore Rendering:</span> Enabled</li>
            <p>This setting allows CSGO to make use of your CPU’s multiple cores. If your CPU only uses one, then you’re okay to keep this setting disabled.</p>
            <li><span>Multisampling Anti-Aliasing Mode:</span> None</li>
            <p>Provides a smooth appearance at the edges.</p>
            <li><span>FXAA Anti-Aliasing:</span> Disabled</li>
            <p>Also smoothes out sharp edges.</p>
            <li><span>Texture Filtering Mode:</span> Bilinear</li>
            <p>Improves the textures.</p>
            <li><span>Wait for Vertical Sync:</span> Disabled</li>
            <p>This setting syncs your monitor HZ rate with FPS. That's why your FPS may be capped.</p>
            <li><span>Motion Blur:</span> Disabled</li>
            <p>Motion blur causes player POV to blur during quick movements.</p>
            <li><span>Uber shaders:</span> Disabled</li>
            <p>Enabling it makes the shading in game stronger.</p>
        </ul>
